## General

 * _Short paragraphs:_ If a paragraph is longer than 5 lines, there should be a good reason why. Is it really 2 ideas (thus 2 paragraphs)? Should some bulk of content be broken into bullets?
 * _Use subheadings:_  Some form of subheading should group each 1-3 paragraphs. A half page or more of unbroken text is an issue.
 * _Use bullets:_ Break large paragraphs into bullets.
