### General

 * _Short paragraphs:_ If a paragraph is longer than 5 lines, there should be a good reason why. Is it really 2 ideas (thus 2 paragraphs)? Should some bulk of content be broken into bullets?
 * _Use subheadings:_  Some form of subheading should group each 1-3 paragraphs. A half page or more of unbroken text is an issue.
 * _Use bullets:_ Break large paragraphs into bullets.

### Specific Rules

| Rule | Bad Example(s) | Good Example(s) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Direct (non-mushy) phrasing | STSI will work to... <br> STSI intends to... <br>We understand that some PMM type deliverables are more applicable... | STSI will... <br> Some PMM deliverables are more applicable... |
| Present tense | The PM will then update the plan... | The PM updates the plan... |
| Active voice | Artifacts are created... | Analysts create artifacts |
| Plain language | With a high multitude of documents and artifacts available... | With many artifacts available... [see also](https://xkcd.com/1133/) |

Notes:

 * Past tense is appropriate for experience citations, since the activity did occur in the past
