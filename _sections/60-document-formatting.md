title: Document Formatting
---

We use MS Word to author proposals. Some rules on formatting options and gotcha's.

 * Left align text, do not justify
 * Do not use Word's hyphenation feature globally (only sparingly in specific blocks of text to fine-tune page layout)
 * Do not use Word's "insert->reference" feature for auto cross-referencing sections/figures/tables
    - Instead, use reference in draft along the lines of "Figure XXX"
    - Hard code figure numbers for final drafts
    - (Yes, it's a pain to manually update, but the alternative is far more dangerous!)
 * Do not manually format text. Do use built-in styles, primarily:
    - Normal
    - Headings (1-4)
    - Subheading
    - Body Bullet
    - Caption
    - Table Text (within a table, obviously)
    - Table Bullet (within a table, obviously)
