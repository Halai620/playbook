### General Review Guidance

 * _Be specific_: Provide very specific, actionable feedback. General feedback ("it's good", "needs work") doesn't help.
 * _Suggest_: Either suggest a specific fix ("Please substantiate this claim - perhaps citing how we configured Documentum at EPA"); or at least a specific direction to fix ("Please substnatiate, ideally citing another Documentum experience at a past project.")
 * _Be candid_: We would rather hear about problems from our reviewers, than in a loss debrief. Snark in comments doesn't help, but direct, critical, candid feedback is always welcome.
 * _Include the Good_: Cite specific positive feedback for important well-done points ("This point really hits home and makes our approach seem real and practical", "This graphic really boils down the approach well and makes it easy to understand") so that authors don't edit out anything good when correcting the bad.

### Colors

STSI is less formal than most. We typically perform only Red and Gold reviews. 

#### Pink Team (Storyboard)

__Objective__: Make sure the draft is going in the right direction.

__Draft Expectation__: (To be refined by Proposal Manager) 

 * A complete outline with a clear place to address any compliance item in the instructions
 * Initial key graphics, text blurbs, or raw bullets of content to convey the gist of important or complex sections
 * Grammar errors, etc., are fine

__Review For__:
 
 * Compliance: Is there is a clear home for all necessary content?
 * Substance: Are sections with partial content/graphics going in the right direction? 
 * Outline Flow: Is the outline logical and likely to flow well from one section to another?
 * _NOT: editorial, writing flow, grammar, spelling_

#### Red Team (Compliance)

__Objective__: Make sure the draft is complete and compliant.

__Draft Expectation__:  

 * A complete draft, with decent quality text in each section
 * Good draft graphics and tables (may not be in "pretty" form yet)
 * Sections should flow well, but may have some rough edges

__Review For__:
 
 * Compliance: Is the draft compliant - contains all required content?
 * Substance: Does the content make sense? Is it accurate?
 * Flow: Do sections fit together in a logical order and flow from one to the next?
 * Win (secondary): In compliant sections, how well will it score? How can we increase the score?
 * Editorial (secondary): Focus on substantive mistakes (wrong client name), not minor style edits.
 * _NOT: detailed editorial and spelling_

#### Gold Team (Win)

__Objective__: Make the draft stand apart in the evaluation process.

__Draft Expectation__:  

 * A complete, winning draft, with high quality text in each section
 * Win themes come through as part of a compelling story
 * Fully compliant
 * Final-form graphics and tables
 * Sections flow well

__Review For__:
 
 * Win: How well will it score? How can we increase the score?
 * Compliance: Is any compliance in doubt?
 * Substance: Does the content make sense? Is it accurate?
 * Flow: Do sections fit together in a logical order and flow from one to the next?
 * Editorial: Is it well written and meets the style guide?

### Workflow

 1. __Author__ creates a draft, optionally saving in the `70_Drafts/[color]` folder while working.
 2. When the draft is ready for review, __Author__ places it in the `70_Drafts/[color]/Ready` folder.
 3. __Reviewer__ turns on track changes, creates MS Word comments. 
 4. If specified, __Reviewer__ completes an evaluation/compliance scorecard spreadsheet.
 5. When done with review, __Reviewer__ places document and scorecard in the `70_Drafts/[color]/Reviewed`
 6. When all reviews are done for a section, the __Proposal Manager__ consolidates reviews into a single document in the `Reviewed` folder. In this case, the PM puts the inidividual source review files in a `Reviewed/Original` subfolder.
 7. __Author__ takes the conslidated review document to move forward with edits.
