# Opportunity Tracking

This guide documents STSI's process and principles for tracking and pursing business opportunities.

## Opportunity Funnel

The below diagram outlines how we track opportunities. This is broken down into 3 major states for a given opportunity, along with actions taken to move opportunities to the next state.

![process overview of opportunity funnel](/images/opp-funnel.png)

* __Identify:__ A new opportunity comes to our attention and begins to be tracked at a high-level.

  * _Validate_ identified opportunities to determine if they are worth pursuing.
  
  * _Reject_ opportunities that are clearly a poor fit from validation.

  * _Hold_ opportunities for which we don't have enough information to properly validate, and revisit them after a time period (usually 3-6 months).

* __Pursue:__ After validating that the opportunity is a strong enough fit, we decide to invest the effort to prepare for and shape the opportunity.

  * Form or seek a team.

  * Market to the relevant customer stakeholders.

  * Research customer needs.

  * When the RFP is released, come to a bid/no-bid decision.

* __Bid:__ When an opportunity has an active RFP (or perhaps draft RFP with a high-confidence schedule), it goes into an active state of preparing the proposal.

  * Carry out the [propsal development process](/topics/proposal.html).

## Identification

### Sources

* __Proactive Relationship Management (best source):__
  * Collaborative shaping of innovative solutions for a given customer
  * Insight into upcoming opportunities based on relationships and communication with target customers

* __GovWin:__
  * _Shared searches_ allow us to get the same alerts for all GovWin users
  * _Ad Hoc searching_ and personal searches

* __eBuy:__
  * Login to eBuy at least 2x/week to look for new opportunities or updates

* __Other:__
  * Customer conversations and relationships
  * Teaming partner conversations
  * ... etc.

### Identification Checklist

Once identified, an opportunity should be:

- [ ] Marked in GovWin (if it exists in GovWin) and add note as to "why"
- [ ] Added to our opportunity tracking sharepoint list
- [ ] Shared via email/slack to the BD team for awareness with a description and link to relevant info (this also tees the item up for discussion in the BD meeting)

## Validation

We research opportunities and validate them against set criteria in order to aid the decision to Pursue or Bid.

### Process

1. _Score_ the opportunity as best we can against the validation criteria.
2. _Note the confidence_ of our rating (based on how good our intel is).
3. _Create and assign actions_ if the opportunity is potentially a strong fit but we have information gaps that can be filled by proactive research.

### Validation Criteria Checklist

* __STSI FIT__
  - [ ] Target client
  - [ ] Focus service area / technology
  - [ ] Comparable qualifications
* __INSIGHT__
  - [ ] We have relationships/PoCs
* __COMPETITION__
  - [ ] No favored incumbent
  - [ ] Small business preference/set-aside
* __PRICING__
  - [ ] Not price shootout or LPTA
  - [ ] Not blind FFP (high pricing risk)

## Bid/No-bid

To make the bid/no-bid decision, we need to determine if the opportunity has the potential to pay off compared to the necessary effort.

The value of an opportunity is based on the __expected value calculation__ (probability x estimated value) rather than simply the _probability to win_.

## Bid Checklist

- [ ] __Re-validation__: Update the validation checklist with any new information.

- [ ] __Probability to Win__: Based on the competitive landscape, what are our chances (<5%, 10-25%, 50%, 75+%)?

- [ ] __Value__: How much is it worth to us if we win?
  - _Expected profit:_ consider both the estimated revenue, as well as potential profit margin (usually rate structure/rate competitiveness)
  - _Growth potential:_ is this the foot in the door for a new client, or an opportunity with substantial likelihood of follow-on work?
  - _Prime/Sub:_ prime opportunities (including CTA member, JV member) are far more attractive than work as a sub.

- [ ] __Effort__: What will it cost us in terms of time, focus, energy, etc.
  - Are there parallel efforts going on competing for resources?
  - Will we need to spend money on external consultants to get it done?

## Teaming

We typically pursue opportunities as part of a team of firms. This allows us to bring a larger set of capabilities and capacity to better serve a customer.

### Team Fit Checklist

For a given opportunity, a team member must provide some value to the opportunity via one or more of the following qualities. Each quality should benefit the eventual _delivery_ and tie to proposal _evaluation crtieria_.

- [ ] Focus on _delivery quality_ and _purpose_ is consistent with our own
- [ ] Add _delivery capabilities or capacity_ that we lack, or that would reduce delivery risk
- [ ] Bring _customer relationships and insights_ that allow us to craft a better fitting solution for the customer
- [ ] Bring specific relevant _past performance_ or _corporate experience_
- [ ] Can provide _key personnel_

### Prospective Team Member Validation Checklist

Before entering into any teaming agreement, we must perform some basic validation of the team member in addition to the strategic questions above.

- [ ] Check SAM.gov to confirm status of firm, particularly any negative filings
- [ ] Check with professional networks (e.g. mine common LinkedIn connections) to ideally find someone who has worked with the firm before
- [ ] Do basic web searching to make sure there are no major public issues
