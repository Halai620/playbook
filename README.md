## Making Changes :pencil2:

The steps to make a change are to:

1. Create a GitHub issue, using the correct issue template and tags, to document what needs to be updated and why
2. Fork the repository or create a branch
3. Make the edits
4. Create a pull request into the `gh-pages` branch

_Note: GitHub makes steps 2-4 rather easy via the web interface. Simply start editing a file, then when it is time to save select the option to create a branch and PR. If you have more changes coming, you can create a Draft PR instead. You can then work on that new branch you created to finalize your batch of changes._

To make edits, add or update files. Note: the formatting is based on [markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) syntax. Markdown supports headings, bullets, tables, emoji, images, links, etc. 

Sections will be ordered by the alpha sort of the file name. Therefore, by prefixing file names with a number, we can control the order.
